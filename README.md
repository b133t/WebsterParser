### A better dictionary for your mac

In the a blog post named [_You’re probably using the wrong dictionary_]
(http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary), James Somers proposes using Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary as it provides more evocative and accurate definitions than most modern dictionaries.

The text of the 1913 version has been digitized and [can be found on Project Gutenberg](ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext96/). Unfortunately the text files are in a very arcane format. Being created before UTF-8 was commonly used, it specifies a lot of non-standard entities to encode the all the various accents and special symbols.

This project parses these original text files and creates a reasonably clean UTF-8 XML version which can be converted into a mac dictionary file with Apple’s Dictionary Kit.

#### How to build

Get the submodule(s). Run:
```
git submodule update --init
```
Or, after pull, to update the submodule(s). Run:
```
git submodule update --remote
```

Build it!
With NodeJS installed, run:
````
npm install
node index.js
````
Building the dictionary might take a while (around three minutes on my machine)


#### Just want the .dictionary file?
Download it in the [releases section](https://github.com/DieBuche/WebsterParser/releases) of this project.


#### Using it on iOS?
You can use the dictionary file on your iDevice if it is jailbroken. SSH into your device and navigate to `/private/var/mobile/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionary2`. 
On your iDevice dowload any new stock dictionary (Select a word -> Define -> Manage -> Download) that you don't need.
In your SSH browser find out which folder was just added. Navigate to folderwithcrypticnumber/AssetData. Replace the .dictionary folder with the webster.dictionary folder, but keeping the name. You should now be able to lookup words. 

I don't know how to change the name of the dictionary in the list, pointers are welcome.
